Python Clairnote Music Library process


JUST UPDATE WITH NEW FILES

0. update the git repo
  - git checkout cn/main5
  - git pull -r upstream master
  - resolve any merge conflicts, hopefully not many

0. make sure you have an "out" directory with just "previous-final.csv" in it
   this is a copy of the previous "full-final.csv"


1. run csv-from-repo script, to generate a CSV file
  - the csv file will only have files of ly vsn 2.14 or higher
  - it has meta data from the old CSV included (omit? etc.) and new items marked as new


2. convert-ly: check new files in csv to see if any need convert-ly
  - if they do, then convert-ly them, manually or with convert-ly.py script
  - manually check the log for errors and note them in the CSV file
  - re-run csv-from-repo to get the updated version info into the csv


3. run mass-edit-lys script to edit ly files
  - takes a csv file and edits those files
  - adds clairnote.ly include line, edits the tagline, copyright, etc.
  - check results with git diff

3. git commit changes to repo


4. run lilypond with mass-run-ly script
  - target specific subsets with command line args
  - produces a4, letter, and midi (turn these on or off in the script)
  - log is saved to a txt file
  - error log file is generated
  - new csv with problems omitted is generated

4. fix any errors worth fixing (including git committing them) and repeat mass-run

4. mark any works to be omitted in the csv file


5. Sort the CSV file by 1. mutopiacomposer 2. cn-opus 3. cn-title  (parse order does not match this on linux...)

5. run csv-to-adds-and-json script to produce new adds report, json, and html
  - this is all in one script so there's one canonical composers list
  - takes a csv data file and logs a list of new items
  - later use this log output to blog about new items
  - catches any missing composers or bad instruments, fix these and repeat before continuing

  - produces json data and html checkboxes for filtering the library
  - optionally edit checkboxes html file by hand for better grouping

  - TODO: check to make sure all items have a style
  - TODO: instrument fields in ly files are a mess...

6. run copy-to-new-directory to create a directory of only the files for the clairnote site
  - use new files status to only copy the new files into this directory

6. upload new files to site
  - PDF, MIDI, & LY files are ftp uploaded to 'sheet-music-files' directory
  - HTML checkboxes are copy/pasted into page-sheet-music-library.php in the clairnote WP theme
  - TODO: generate the whole page-sheet-music-library.php file with python to eliminate cut and paste step
  - the new sheet-music-lib-data.js goes in the WP theme's /js/ directory


7. rename "out" directory to "out-2015-12-05" and create a new "out" directory
7. copy previous final CSV into new out directory and rename to "previous-final.csv"
7. edit previous-final.csv to remove new status on all items
7. delete old "mutopia-clairnote-out-..." directory with copies of pdfs and midis that are in the repo

Notes on using git with Clairnote mutopia project

https://github.com/MutopiaProject/MutopiaProject/wiki/Setting-up-for-Contributions-via-GITHUB

- use the same fork and clone as I use to work on mutopia stuff
- create clairnote branches for clairnote library work


####
regular mutopia work remains on local master and topic branches as usual:

  git checkout master
  git fetch upstream
  git merge upstream/master
  

####
Branch: cn/trad

This branch only has commits fixing up the files for parsing (fixing metadata, etc.).
Branches converting to clairnote should be based on this branch.
Update this branch with latest mutopia changes with:

  git checkout cn/trad
  git pull -r upstream master

This does a git pull and git rebase putting my commits at the end of the commit log.  


####
Branch cn/main5

This branch has conversions to Clairnote on it, 
and is originally based on cn/trad 
(how to get additional cn/trad changes into it?)

Update this branch with latest mutopia changes with:

  git checkout cn/main5
  git pull -r upstream master

- there should not be any merge conflicts unless someone updates a file that I have locally updated with convert-ly.  And then it should be easy to resolve the merge conflicts.

- the only changes to the files in this branch are adding \include "clairnote.ly" and the new footer fields.  This should usually be done with python script, but can be done manually if need be.

- make sure to commit any changes.





- NOTE: we are using 'pull' and 'rebase' (pull -r) instead of 'fetch' and 'merge'.  This keeps our commits at the most recent position in the history, with upstream changes and additions coming before them.
